**Help**

The purpose of this page is to aid the user in using the application to the best of it. 

**Navigation**

The navigation throughout the application can be made with the bottom navigation buttons, for the main pages and with the help of the buttons and menu items from those pages.

**Speech Rehearsal**

For the speech rehearsal feature, it is recommended to firstly set some filler words that the speaker would like to remove from his speech.

This can be achieved by tapping the lower part of the first screen. On the "Set Filler Words" page, words can be added in any language. No Emojis or special characters should be used, in order to avoid unexpected results. A filler word can be deleted by tapping the "X" button. After the removal of a word, a message with the option to undo the action is briefly shown.

After the words were set, the user should go back to the previous screen and tap the upper part, going to the "Speech Rehearsal" page. If no stable internet connection is found, the button will not work, and a message will be shown on screen.

From the "Public Speaking Assistant" page, the user can select the desired language of the speech, by using the application bar button, and then simply press the microphone floating button, that will start the process of listening. A glowing effect on the button exists in order to highlight the fact that the application listens for speech.

When the user finished his speech, the button should be pressed again, and a new page with results will be shown. Statistic about the speech can be found here, tips on how to improve the speech and a full transcript. After settings a title, the speech can be saved locally.

**Library**

The "Library" page contains all the saved speeches. By tapping on one, the user can see the full transcript and even see the statistics with tips on improving, by using the button from the application bar, from inside the transcript page. 
	
Any speech can be synced to or unsynced from cloud, if an account is currently logged-in, by tapping the icon depicting a cloud.
	
Speeches can be deleted by swiping from left to right. If a speech was also synced, it will be deleted from cloud too. After the removal of a speech, a message with the option to undo the action is briefly shown.
	
In the case when no internet connection exists, the syncing will be made as soon as a connection is found.

**Account**

The first option from the "Settings" page stands for the "Account". A new account can be created with an email and a password, or through a Google account.

Once an account was created, a confirmation email is sent. After the email was confirmed, the user should log in again, and the account page will be shown. 

From the account page, previously synced speeches can be downloaded. The account and all of its data can also be deleted from the application bar button.
	
In the case the password was forgotten, it can be reset by tapping the "Forgot password?" button, from the login page.

**Appearance**

The second option from the "Settings" page shows the Appearance page. From here, the user can switch between light and dark theme, or even select a desired color for several components from the application. By tapping a circle with color corresponding to an option, a dialog with several colors and shades is shown.

**Informative Pages**
